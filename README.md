# NYC_BIKE_VIZ
## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
> THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS WAS TO IDENTIFY THE VARIATIONS IN TIMING FOR CHECKOUT TIMES BASED ON GENDER AND IN GENERAL
> ALSO TO LOOK INTO THE ASPECT OF POPULAR LOCATIONS. ALL THESE ANALYSIS IS TO VISUALLY REPRESENT THE DATA TO INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THE SEASONALITY AND GENDER SPECIFICITY OF BIKE SHARING RIDES. 

## RESULTS
> THE RESULTS WERE AS EXPECTED WITH MALE RIDERS DOMINATING OVER THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN TERMS OF BEING SUBSCRIBERS MOST RIDERS. ALSO THE MOST HIGHLY USED TIME DURING THE DAY WAS BETWEEN 5PM AND 7PM.

## RECOMMENDATION/SUMMARY
> LOCATION DATA CAN BE UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY HOTSPOTS, AND LOCAL ATTRACTIONS TO FORECAST FUTURE USAGE OF RIDE SHARING. ALTHOUGH THE LEAST USAGE HOURS ARE 2AM TO 5AM IT IS NOT A VIABLE RECOMMENDATION FOR MAINTENANCE HOURS AS ITS DEAD AT NIGHT. IF WE HAD REPAIR SHOP DATA WE COULD IDENTIFY BASED ON HOURS OF OPERATION WHEN WOULD BE THE BEST TIME TO VISIT.
